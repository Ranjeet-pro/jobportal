The objective of Job Portal is to facilitate both the candidates seeking jobs
as well as the employers looking for employees for their companies. In this
online web application, any job seeker can search for the available jobs at
any moment with updated information. When he finds a job, he can post his
application to the job online. Employers can advertise the vacancies by
taking the membership, logging in and posting the job information with the
eligibility criteria for the jobs. This software establishes a direct connection
between the employer and the job seeker. A job seeker can directly visit
this portal and view the jobs availability information along with downloading
the required information. When he logs into the system, he would be able
to upload his application and post walk-in details which he knows would be
held by a company. This information helps other users very much to attend
the same. Further, the user will be able to view the list of companies for
which he has already applied. This enables him to make a decision when
he gets a call from a company and how much time elapsed since he has
applied for the company. A registered user will be able to get useful
information regarding the placement papers and sample resumes which
help him to create his own resume according to industry standards.
Common interview questions and sample covering letters are also available
online along with FAQâ€™s which aid the candidate to pave his route into the
job world. Thus Job portal management is a common platform where
corporate recruiters and job seekers come under the same roof# jobportal
